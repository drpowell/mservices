                Market storage (also known as Market-file) is a disk-based storage product that is designed to support research data that is accessed regularly (usually every day) by researchers. Market storage closely resembles the Monash University S:\ Drive and is suitable for data that changes frequently and needs to be available for daily work but is too large to be stored on a local machine. Vault storage is a tape-based storage product that is designed to accommodate long-term data storage and is best used for data that must be retained for reference but is unlikely to be accessed every day. Vault is also the best place to store redundant backups of data that is being stored locally.
